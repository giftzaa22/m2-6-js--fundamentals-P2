// Exercise 2
// -------------------
const lateComers = ['Felicia', 'Charles', 'Terry'];
const earlyBirds = ['Ellen', 'Jerry', 'Jasmine'];


const guests = lateComers.concat(earlyBirds);

guests.forEach(function(item,num){
console.log(`${num}:${item}`)
});
// You have two arrays above of people who arrived late to your party and
// people who arrived early.
// Create a new array that holds all of the party attendees and

// Write a program that will do the following:
// Output them in a tidy list from first to last arrival the console.

// NO for loops!
